  - ADD SOUND EFFECTS FOR IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY BITS (ex: enemies getting hit, picking up metal, etc.)
  - Add kissyfish kiss (Important)
  - Add loads more bubble spawners all over (amazing how much heavy lifting those can do)

Remove green checkpoint wall in last level



Disable light beam when bo gets merc'd


CHECKPOINTS
- Be sure to block earlier levels if you try to backtrack


// Flashlight for 3rd level
Change metal gib hitbox
More spikes in first level, but not too many
Improve gibs on spitter and ADD BLOOD GIBS
Place metal better in 2nd level maybe
Check spike hitboxes in 2 and 3


- Need to destroy dithering behind checkpoints
- Edit that one shrimp checkpoint
- Phantasia doesn't jump out of way 


- Harpoon bugs
  - Overshooting terrain target causes you to not always move towards the hook
  // Should be able to release a grapple from grabbing a rock
  - Chain sometimes gets separated from hook
  // Applying knockback to enemies could help combat a little as well (do this to pile bunker as well)
  // Limit range of harpoon so you can't shoot it forever
  - Would be a good idea to add a very slight delay before you can shoot your harpoon again
  // Ditch harpoon counter + harpoon being removed by dealing damage
  - Breaking up rocks you hit instead of pulling them close might be better since thats the only way the mechanic is used right now

- Enemy placement (50%)
  - Not fun at all to fight enemies in cramped areas, but also important not to give you too much open space
  - Enemies should be tough to fight, but shouldn't tear you a new one - survival theme is important
  // Essentially greater durability, greater aggression
  - Try to avoid larger clusters of enemies if possible
  // - Polish shrimp AI
  // Polish spitter AI
  // - Polish pufferfish AI
  - REALLY polish phantasia AI

- Collision (75%)
  // Desperately need to add dedicated square collision layer for tiles
  // Main layer should probably be moved to foreground / above player so harpoon doesn't overlay it

- Dialog pacing + mood
  - Avoid overloading an area with dialog, put plenty of actual gameplay between (not too much of an issue right now but could stand to be tweaked)
  - Need to do a VC to crank out the city properly
  // Add dialog skip button
