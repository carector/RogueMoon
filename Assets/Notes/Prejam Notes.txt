**Main gameplay**
- Two main characters who occupy a big sub robot
  - Diver who pilots it - explores + hunts resources
  - Mechanic who keeps the robot functional and can craft things from resources
  - Metal gear-style radio conversations between the two


- Movement
  - Slow and difficult to move around this bigass robot
  - Can move freely if you're not touching anything, but releasing inputs makes you sink

- Harpoon gun
  - Used for movement and combat
  - Harpoon uses finite resource to reinforce survival horror theme
  - Can risk damaging enemies with harpoon or use it to more safely escape threats - resource management
  - Harpoon drags things towards you if your feet are planted
  - Harpoon drags you towards it if your feet are not planted
  - Can recover harpoons that get stuck in walls, but need to hold a button for a second to get it

- Pile bunker
  - Very strong point blank weapon
  - Extremely risky to use, if you miss the piston takes time to recharge

- Dash move 
  - Long recharge time but lets you avoid danger once or twice

- Crafting + resources
  - A couple of key resources - keep it as simple as we can
  - Go to menu and decide what you want to make
    - Harpoons
    - Some sort of 
  - Break down moon rocks + other undersea things for metals from harpoons
     - Occasionally throw in things that look like earth objects that server the same purpose (but don't be too obvious)
     - Hard geometric shapes that people don't think much about, but later bring them back for the city

- Levels
  - Should funnel you downwards
  - Wide open spaces that leave you vulnerable - no walls to grapple to, fish can come from anywhere
  - Fish come at you fast as fuck 

- Enemy ideas
  - Leeches: Stick to robot and siphon health / resources, can shake them off by using a harpoon to pull yourself away quickly or by dodging

**Setting + Story**
- Rogue moon that entered the solar system
- Implied that its origins are terrestrial, with the reveal of the city at the bottom of the depths
- Essentially a chunk of the earth where weird shit happened


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ideas**
- Radar UI element: small screen size forces you to rely on radar at times
- Pitch black areas eventually might help play off that

- Towards the end, the back of the sub opens up without warning and the mechanics gets ejected out, drowns / gets depressurized
- From this point on you can't craft shit + use the sub(?)

- Robot/sub you find near the bottom of the sea that's barely functional
- Guy inside that's all fucked up with tubes in him (optional: he's just Slick and it's our Grunge easter egg)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sprites + Canvas sizes**
- 256x224 (SNES canvas size)
- SNES Style sprites
- UI will not be upscaled like it was in Grunge
- **BE SURE TO KEEP CANVAS SIZES ON MULTIPLES OF 16**
- Each tile should be 16x16
- Main robot sprite w/ separated arms so we can rotate things freely
- Dialog portraits are in metal slug / snes / retro anime style
