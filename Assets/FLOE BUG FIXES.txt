// Fix two pieces of module statagtite that are hanging off the surface of the first cave where you discover the alloy
// Give the bozo skeleton a level 2 darkness overlay, or something more complex and sexy (will specify if you'd like) located near the red coral and fern area
- The cryptid missing tile at the very bottom of the first tunnel down
// Apply hitbox to the cornerless rock pieces and each piece of slope
// Fix the dafoeboxes, determine if they should be lowered based on if the player is able to see the terrain clipping / fly over top them and stand on them, maybe make it so they can be phased through during a cutscene where the mech falls through the water (I plan on making an animation for the giant crane to drop the mech into the water)
// Fix the microscopic shading issue that is located at the bottom of the secret area pit that connects to the spiky area
// Remove the shading on the single block tile that is in same said area

// Bone zone
