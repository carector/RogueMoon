SFX TO ADD
// Thrust sound
- Random underwater ambience
- Fish gore sounds
- Harpoon impact sound
- Rock and coral crumbles
- Bump into fish sound
- Metal alloy dinky dink sounds


BUGS / TWEAKS
- Fish clouds move in 3D, can sometimes clip through parallax
- Make non-speaking portraits slightly darker
//? Can see end of parallax if you walk to rightmost side of top area
// Rapidly tapping hover can mute hover sound if done correctly
- Update fish to turn around when hitting spikes (and maybe walls)
- Steam particle systems dont work in webgl build
- Disable thrust sound when dialog plays
//? Remaining thrust meter
//? Kissyfish kiss
//? Try to improve fish pathfinding (maybe use nodes or navmesh)
- Mute reload sound when in dialog
//? Make fish bounce back if you bump into them (can knock you out of grapple)
- Fix mech arm animation when in midair (currently plays walking animation)
- Add a lot more metal health pickups in levels

THINGS LEFT TO MAKE
- New boss fish
- Pause menu
- Improved title screen + intro sequence
- Bigger reward for discovering side areas
